## Core Features:

- Wallet-Linked Plant: Generates a unique digital plant associated with the user's wallet address. The plant's state reflects the wallet's on-chain activity.
- On-Chain Growth: Monitors the user's on-chain actions and translates them into plant growth, blossoming, or wilting animations.
- Growth Log: Displays a timeline of wallet activities, visualized as growing leaves, buds, or branches, creating a history of growth.
- Community Grove: Showcases multiple users' plants together in a shared virtual grove, with larger, more vibrant plants indicating active wallets.
- Plant Customization Forge: Enables users to spend earned "growth points" to customize their plants, choosing different species, color palettes, leaf shapes, and particle effects.
- AI Plant Identifier Tool: Uses generative AI as a tool to identify the plant and its characteristics in order to create plant growth effects, blooming variations, leaf shapes, and other particle effects for the display
- Wilting Mode: Represents wallet inactivity through subtle visual cues such as drooping leaves and dimmed colors, with a gentle "revive" animation upon reactivation.
