🌱 Temporal Garden
A living digital plant that grows with your on-chain activity.

Temporal Garden is a calming, nature-inspired Web3 dApp where every wallet owns a unique, evolving digital plant.
Your plant grows, blooms, or wilts based entirely on your blockchain activity — turning your on-chain life into a peaceful, living artwork.

This project blends nature, animation, and decentralized identity into a single serene experience.

🌿 Core Concept

Every wallet = one plant.

Your wallet’s activity directly influences your plant’s Life Cycle:

Active transactions → new leaves, branches, blossoms

Smart contract interactions → rare growth events

Long-term inactivity → gentle wilting

Consistent engagement → unlocks new species and colors

Your plant becomes a visual representation of your on-chain journey.
